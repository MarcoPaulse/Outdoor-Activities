    <h3>Hiking</h3>
        <h4>Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens/Newlands Forest</h4>    
            <p>
                    A walk in the woods...
                    <br>
                    Situated on the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, Newlands Forest is a favourite among (dog) walkers, trail runners, leisurely strollers, serious hikers, nature lovers, picnickers and locals wanting to let off steam after a gruelling day at the office. Here’s why we love it:
                    <br>
                    ROAM
                    <br>
                    Avid hikers use the forest as an entry to the four unique trails that wind up the mountain. These trails range from easy to moderate, and boast several vantage points along the way that offer exquisite views stretching from the city centre to Blouberg.
                    
                    Leisurely strollers entering the forest from the parking area will come across a sign with information detailing the various routes. The easier routes are made up of interlinking paths, with a few streams in between, and stunning views of the surrounding suburbs. Dogs are welcome as long as owners are carrying an activity permit otherwise they will be fined.

                    The City Parks Nursery in Newlands is well worth a visit. It includes four large greenhouses and a large area of growing land.

                    <br>
                    Bring your own wood, charcoal and grid and prepare lunch among the trees in the designated braai and picnic areas (featured in our Best Braai Spots in Cape Town). Most of the stream-side picnic spots are protected by a canopy of trees, providing shade in summer and protection from (light) rain in winter.

        <h4>Lion's Head</h4>
            <p>
               Looming above Cape Town and the surrounding ocean like a sentinel, Lion’s Head is an iconic piece of the city’s wondrous topography. At 669 meters above sea level, its peak offers panoramic views of the city, Table Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, making it a wildly popular destination for hiking enthusiasts (and a top spot for Instagrammers). 
            <br>
                Lion’s Head Hiking Trail: Duration and Difficulty
                A relatively short hike lasting around two to three hours, the Lion’s Head trail winds its way around the mountain, offering incredible views along the way (that still pale in comparison to what’s visible from the summit).

                The route is clearly marked, and most of it can be easily traversed by foot (the path from the parking lot runs uphill for quite a while, offering a particularly good workout). There is a little rock scrambling as you near the summit, but the only part of the trail that could be considered intimidating are the metal ladders and climbing chains required to ascend the rock face at one point. Thankfully, these can be skipped via a roundabout foot path.

                It’s no wonder that the Lion’s Head trail is the most popular among the Cape’s many hikes: it’s relatively short, offers a great workout, and the views from the summit are well worth the trip.

    <h3>Camping</h3>
        <h4>Apostle Battery Campsite</h4>
            <p>
                Apostle Battery is a campsite situated on the slopes of Table Mountain near Llandudno, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.  
            <br>
            The site originates from the Second World War and was used as a defence force base for many years; Three nine-inch artillery guns are still found on the site.  
            <br>
            Since 1993, thousands of young people have attended well-organised camps on the A and B sites of Apostle Battery.  Over the years the programs have focused on:
            <ul>
                <li>youth leadership</li>
                <li>character-building</li>
                <li>environmental education</li> 
                <li>YLAC – Youth leaders against crime</li>
                <li>holiday programs for underprivileged children from informal settlements</li>
                <li>religious camps</li>
                <li>several other youth development programs</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            The CPA also facilitates regular moral building programs, as well as stress-release and religious programs to members of the SAPS.
            <br>
            Many of the young people who attend the camps (app. 250 – 300 per month) come from informal settlements, such as Imizamo Yethu, Du Noon, Sir Lowry’s Pass Village, etc.  The natural splendour of the camp site and the introduction of life-changing values assist with developing better self-esteem and an appreciation for nature in these young people.
            <br>
            Most of the programs and camps are facilitated by the professional youth team of JAM (Jabulani African Ministries) who stay and work on the premises.
